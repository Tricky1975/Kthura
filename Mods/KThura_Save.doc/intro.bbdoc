<p align='center' style='background-color:#ff0000; color:#ffff00'>NOTICE!!!<br>This module is still in development so many features will not work properly. Or most likely not at all.<br>I recommend not to use this module until this notice has been removed</p>

<p>This module is written in order to save Kthura maps from BlitzMax.<br>
This module was solely written in order to make creating an editor possibe ;)<br> 
The Kthura system was named after the main protagonist of the adventure game M&ouml;rker as that was the first game to use this system.
