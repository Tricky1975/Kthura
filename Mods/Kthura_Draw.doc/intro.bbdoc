<p align='center' style='background-color:#ff0000; color:#ffff00'>NOTICE!!!<br>The base of this module is currently done, however, this module is still in development.<br>Most features should work now, but keep in mind it my still be buggy and some features may be added, changed or removed.<br>Use at your own risk.</p>

<p>This module was made to draw Kthura maps in Max2D.<br>
I placed this routine in a separate module in order to enable you to write an alternate routine to do this if you desire, if you do, then simply import the core only and not this module. If you import this module you will no longer have to imort the core as that will then happen automatically.
