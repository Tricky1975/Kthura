<p align='center' style='background-color:#ff0000; color:#ffff00'>NOTICE!!!<br>This module is still in development so many features will not work properly. Or most likely not at all.<br>I recommend not to use this module until this notice has been removed</p>

<p>This module was made to draw Kthura maps in Max2D.<br>
I placed this routine in a separate module in order to enable you to write an alternate routine to do this if you desire, if you do, then simply import the core only and not this module. If you import this module you will no longer have to imort the core as that will then happen automatically.
