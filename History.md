- 15.07.29: Modify alpha ignore bug fixed
- 15.08.01: Export to png and jpg now supported
- 15.08.01: Git scripted updated with the possibility to keep this changelog up to date :)
- 15.08.01: Tiny bug in that updater fixed (doh!)
- 15.08.01: (FIX) Export now only works if the canvas is visible. Otherwise the editor will produce undesirable behavior!
- 15.08.04: Drawing routines now allows CSpots (which is all object of which the "kind" is prefixed with an $)
- 15.08.04: Scripting engine there. Does it work?
- 15.08.04: Fixed up issue non-detection of custom spots

- 15.08.05: Fixed the unreadable error messages bug
- 15.08.05: General Data can now be edited in a Kthura map (if you were wondering about that empty data file inside a Kthura JCR6 file, now you got it) :)
- 15.08.16: First version considered in 'Alpha' (though earlier releases exist, this is where the project has been declared safe enough to use, though keep in mind that stuff may still be subject to change)
- 15.08.16: Documentation has been adapted to this new status in all three modules. (I will only make this notice in the core, but this one and the previous one goes for all mods in Kthura).
- 15.08.16: Quick data access within a Kthura map done
- 15.08.16: BUGFIX: The actor pic synchronizer returned null if a picture was already loaded. This has been fixed as it had to return the memory reference of the loaded picture already. (Trying to save memory, don't you sometimes just hate it) :)
- 15.08.16: BUGFIX: Auto hotspot bottom center for single pic actors. I forgot to set this right ;)

- 15.08.23: Area effect support

- 15.09.22: Deprecated a few older setups meant for animation, but it was clear they were not going to be used from the start. The saver ignores them now. The loader still sees them, but will throw a warning. After "Star Story" has been finished it's very likely to be removed form the loader as well.
