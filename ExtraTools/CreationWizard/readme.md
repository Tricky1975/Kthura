# Kthura Quick Project Wizard

This is a little Wizard to quickly set up a Kthura Project written in C#
Please note, when you are a Mac user, you will require to have Mono installed or the wizard will not run.

I hear you ask, why C# and Mono? Well unlike BlitzMax I can at least be sure those two frameworks will exist for the time being, even if I have to move the Kthura Map Editor into a new environment, this tool will work. That's basically it. ;)
(Although a few adaptions may be in order, as I have a few things in mind for project management when I redo Kthura in a different environment, but as no new framework has yet been chosen to do this in, do not expect this to happen soon). ;)
