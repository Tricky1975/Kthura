# Kthura map editor (BlitzMax)

This is the source code of the Kthura map editor. This is a simple object based map system written in BlitzMax.
It should work on OS X, Windows and Linux are untested, though I don't expect trouble in Windows, and for Linux... Well BlitzMax officially supports Linux, but the BlitzMax and Linux have never been good friends (for good reasons).

At the current stage I did not have the time to fully document this, plus the system is officially still in development.

To import the Kthura map system into your own map you can best go to http://github.com/Tricky1975/TrickyMods as Kthura can be found there as a fully set up BlitzMax module, plus the other modules you need to compile Kthura (as well the modules as the editor) can be found there.

Notes for Mac Users:
- As of version 15.09.22 the Kthura Map Editor requires at least 10.6 (Snow Leopard) to run, 10.7 (Lion) or later is actually recommended. 
- The Text Editor requires at least 10.4 (Tiger) to run at the present time, however after the next update of that the same restriction as goes for the Text Editor
- The modules have no restriction, since they basically "adapt" to the OS X version on which you compile them 

If you want you can import the other two files as well. You also might want to choose for http://trickymods.tbbs.nl where fully setup BlitzMax modules have already been created for you (and there are other modules in there as well you need to compile any file in this repository anyway) :-P
