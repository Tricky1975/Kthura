# Kthura map editor (blitzMax)

This is the source code of the Kthura map editor. This is a simple object based map system written in BlitzMax.
It should work on OS X, Windows and Linux are untested, though I don't expect trouble in Windows, and for Linux... Well BlitzMax officially supports Linux, but the BlitzMax and Linux have never been good friends (for good reasons).

At the current stage I did not have the time to fully document this, plus the system is officially still in development.

The files in the Mods folder can be separate imported into your system. You can also use them in a module by simply creating a .bmx file containing code like this:
   module mymodule.kthura
   import "Kthura_core.bmx"

If you want you can import the other two files as well. You also might want to choose for http://trickymods.tbbs.nl where fully setup BlitzMax modules have already been created for you (and there are other modules in there as well you need to compile any file in this repository anyway) :-P
